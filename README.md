# Description (en)
A first person shooter game made in Unity Engine. I worked on it with Gatina Claudiu. It was a project for a faculty subject, but the theme was chosen by me. It is a single-player game, with 2 maps, menus and a win condition: kill all enemies. The enemies are just some dummies, but you have to find them. 
Used languages: c#, javascript.
